## 🗂️ Notebooks Overview

Each notebook covers a specific step in the app’s development process:

1. **LoanPredict(unbalanced).ipynb**: Trains models on unbalanced dataset
2. **DefaultPredict(balanced).ipynb**: Trains models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), evaluates metrics, and visualizes results on balanced dataset.
